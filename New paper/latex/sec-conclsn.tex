\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclsn}
In this paper, we proposed a robust probabilistic resource allocation model that copes with the uncertainties exist both in communication and computation. We leveraged the probabilistic model to devise a load balancer that operates at the \bs~(edge) level and distributes arriving tasks to other \bs s in the face of oversubscription. Experimental results express that our proposed model can significantly improve the robustness of the system (by up to 90\%), when the system is seriously oversubscribed. As a result, the whole V2I system is more robust and reliable in emergency situation. From simulation results it is observed that for the various amounts of arriving task our proposed heuristic outperforms the MECT. About only 5\% of all tasks miss their deadlines using the MR heuristic, where more than 90\% of the testing tasks miss their deadline with the MECT heuristic. In future, we plan to extend our probabilistic model for cases that have heterogeneity within each \bs. We also plan to study the impact of the initial oversubscription level and deadline looseness on the system. Another avenue of future research is to incorporate delay tolerant and intolerant tasks together in a \bs in a situation of oversubscription.%direction of movement.
