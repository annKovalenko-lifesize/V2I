We review known NPâ€hardness results and compile the results on the worstâ€case performance of approximation algorithms. Some directions for future research are suggested. The presentation is based on two discussion sessions during the Workshop to Investigate Future Directions in Routing and Scheduling of Vehicles and Crews, held at the University of Maryland at College Park, June 4â€“6, 1979.}
