\section{Scenario}\label{sec:scenario}



%End-to-end delay is composed of three contributing factors \cite{mostafa2011}, namely up-link delay, processing delay, and downlink delay. In end-to-end delay ``uplink delay" and ``down-link delay" can be defined as communication delay. Whereas processing delay can be defined as ``computational delay".
