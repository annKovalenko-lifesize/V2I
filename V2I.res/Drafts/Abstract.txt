Abstract — The concept of vehicular networks requires quick and reliable services due to the nature of the road environment. Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communication should provide consistent real-time response to be useful for the driver. The majority of the services provided by vehicular networks are delay intolerant. Road accidents or increased traffic can only worsen the situation and increase the overall delay. Many services of such kind have no value once the deadline has passed. In our research, we propose a robust recourse allocation model which decreases the number of service requests that miss the deadline without compromising the Quality of Service (QoS). The model includes a Load Balancer component that allocates the arriving tasks between neighbouring Roadside Units prior the internal allocation to the virtual machines (VMs). To decrease a deadline missing rate and, therefore, increase the QoS we propose a probabilistic allocation model based on historical data of the tasks completion times. Historical data stored at the edge and updated through the cloud. Task allocation directly depends on the calculated probability of the task to meet its deadline in all of the neighbouring Roadside Units. Additionally, different scheduling policies within the Roadside Unit have been considered to increase robustness. Simulation results demonstrate that proposed allocation model provides 40 % decrease in task deadline missing rate compare to conventional Roadside Unit architecture.
