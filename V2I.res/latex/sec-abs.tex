\begin{abstract}
Autonomous vehicles require fast and reliable services to manage road hazards. Services provided in these networks (\eg traffic information and natural disaster updates) are generally delay intolerant. Hence, Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) systems must provide consistent real-time response to autonomous vehicles. Maintaining real-time response can be particularly difficult, at a disaster time, when there is a surge of request arrivals to \bs s with edge computing capabilities. Accordingly, our goal is to make the system robust (\ie able to maintain its performance) against uncertain task arrival. To achieve robustness, we propose a resource allocation model that can load balance (\ie dynamically utilize resources from neighboring \bs s), when the system is oversubscribed. We propose a method to calculate the probability of completing an arriving task on time on different base stations. Then, the load balancer assigns the task to the base station that maximizes the probability of completing the task before its deadline. We evaluate our proposed model under different workload conditions and when different scheduling policies are deployed within \bs s. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed allocation model decreases deadline miss rate by up to 90\%  when compared with conventional V2I systems.
