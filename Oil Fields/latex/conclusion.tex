\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusion}
In this paper, we have presented a robust resource allocation model using Edge Computing that copes with the uncertainties exists both in communication and computation for offshore smart oil fields. We leveraged the task deadline and historical data for completion time to devise a coordinator that operates near the smart oil field(Edge Level) and distribute arriving tasks to most certain \pu(Edge or Cloud) in the face of oversubscription focusing the nature of the task type(\eg~real-time, delay intolerant). Experimental results express that our proposed model can improve the robustness of the system compared to distant cloud data center working similarly in case of disaster or emergency-related tasks. From simulation result, it is observed that for various amounts of arriving task our proposed heuristic outperforms the baseline and task type heuristics. about 17\% of all tasks miss their deadline using the certainty coordinator, where more than 22.26\% tasks miss their deadline with baseline and task type heuristics. In future, we plan to extend our proposed model to work more efficiently by changing different concepts to improve the performance and extend the model for cases that have heterogeneity within each \pu(Edge and Cloud). We also plan to study the impact of the initial oversubscription level and deadline looseness on the system for incorporating all the task type including delay tolerant and intolerant tasks.
